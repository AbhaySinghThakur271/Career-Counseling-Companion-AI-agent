# ☁️ IBM Cloud Services Used
## IBM Cloud Watsonx AI Studio
IBM Watsonx.ai Studio is a powerful AI development environment on IBM Cloud that enables users to build, train, and deploy AI models using both traditional machine learning and foundation models (like IBM Granite). It supports low-code/no-code workflows, integrates with Watsonx data for governance, and provides tools for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), natural language processing, and custom AI solutions.

It's ideal for building intelligent assistants, like our Career Counseling Companion AI, with enterprise-grade scalability, security, and explainability.
## IBM Cloud Watsonx AI runtime
BM Watsonx.ai Runtime provides the infrastructure and tools needed to deploy and serve AI models in production. It allows developers to run both custom-trained models and foundation models (like IBM Granite) efficiently, with support for scalable inference, secure APIs, and low-latency responses.

In the context of our Career Counseling Companion AI, the runtime ensures that the AI assistant can deliver real-time, reliable, and personalized responses to users at any time.
## IBM Cloud Agent Lab
IBM Cloud AgentLab is a collaborative development environment within IBM Cloud, designed specifically for building, testing, and deploying AI-powered agents. It enables teams to easily connect IBM foundation models (like Granite) with tools like Watsonx.ai, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and external data sources.

With AgentLab, developers can:

Rapidly prototype AI assistants using low-code/no-code interfaces

Configure agent behavior, personality, and memory

Integrate APIs and knowledge bases for smarter, contextual responses

In our Career Counseling Companion AI, AgentLab plays a key role in managing the agent’s interactions, data retrieval, and personalized career guidance delivery.
## IBM Granite foundation model
IBM Granite is a family of large foundation models developed by IBM for enterprise-grade AI applications. These models are trained on diverse, trusted data and support tasks like natural language understanding, generation, classification, summarization, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

Granite models are built with a focus on:

Transparency & trustworthiness

Domain-specific accuracy

Responsible AI and governance

In our Career Counseling Companion AI, Granite powers the assistant's ability to understand student queries, generate personalized guidance, and evolve through interactions—making it feel like a knowledgeable and reliable career coach.
